# WeatherStation
This is the repo for my selfmade WeatherStation based on the ESP32 board. This repo is forked from the ESPFirmware, which was published by myself on the PrivateHomeIoT account.

## Sensors
- DHT11
- BMP280/BME280
- Rain sensor (capacative, analog)
- Soil moisture sensor (capacative, without electronics, analog)
- Soil moisture sensor (capacative, with electronics, analog)
- Battery voltage (analog)

## Pinout
- DHT11 --> 25
- BMP280/BME280 --> SDA: 21, SCL: 22
- Rain sensor --> 32
- Soil moisture sensor #1 --> 35
- Soil moisture sensor #2 --> 33
- Battery --> 27
